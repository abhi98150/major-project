document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Example: initialize any components or handle specific interactions here

    // If you need to handle any specific responsive behaviors, you can add them here
    // This example is basic as the Colorlib design might not need extra JS for basic table responsiveness
});
